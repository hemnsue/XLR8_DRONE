# XLR8_DRONE

XLR8 is the offcial team from SRM Ist. KTR participating in the SAE India Autonomous Drone Development Challenge
The integration of autonomous medical delivery drones presents a groundbreaking solution for scenarios where immediate access to medical aid is imperative, yet human intervention is limited or delayed. By simply providing GPS coordinates, individuals in need can swiftly summon vital medical packages to their location, potentially saving lives in critical situations.

The drone is trained to precisely land and deliver the medical supplies then again takeoff and return to the base ground station.
