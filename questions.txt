Questions i have----
1)How to manipulate the height of the drone , i mean for going down in guided mode, all i see is the code for going up and going down, is it like using global_relative_frame.alt if we set simple take off in negative values it will go down or what is the thing here because i have to manipulate it according to my will
2)The global_relative_frame gives the answer for what? Is it like it's minuses my data from my base location or home location or something else,,,,,, 
3)vehicle.homelocation changes continuously or is it like once it's loaded in , it's saved and it won't change
