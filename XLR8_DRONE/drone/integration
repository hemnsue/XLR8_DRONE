You're correct; my apologies for the oversight. Connecting the telemetry module directly to the Jetson Nano isn't necessary for the purpose of transmitting telemetry data from the Pixhawk. Instead, you should indeed connect the telemetry module directly to the Pixhawk.

Here's the corrected approach:

    Connect Telemetry Module to Pixhawk: Most telemetry modules compatible with Pixhawk connect via serial communication (UART). You'll typically connect the telemetry module to one of the UART ports on the Pixhawk.

    Configure Telemetry Module: Configure the telemetry module according to its documentation. Ensure that the telemetry module is set up to communicate with the ground station at the desired baud rate and frequency.

    Pixhawk and Jetson Nano Connection: If the Jetson Nano is handling video processing and transmission, ensure it's connected to the Pixhawk for any necessary communication related to autonomy or control.

    Integration with Jetson Nano for Video Transmission: Write Python code on the Jetson Nano to handle video capture from the Raspberry Pi camera, encode it for transmission, and send it over the telemetry module along with telemetry data.

    Receive on Ground Station: On the ground station side, receive telemetry data and video frames using a matching telemetry module and decode them for display.

Here's a corrected version of the Python code example, assuming the telemetry module is connected to the Pixhawk and the Jetson Nano is handling video transmission:





import cv2
import serial

# Initialize serial communication with the telemetry module
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 57600)  # Adjust port and baud rate as needed

# Initialize camera capture
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Assuming camera is connected to Jetson Nano

while True:
    # Capture frame-by-frame
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Encode frame to JPEG format
    _, encoded_frame = cv2.imencode('.jpg', frame)

    # Send encoded frame over serial
    ser.write(encoded_frame.tobytes())

    # Break the loop if 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release resources
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()


Ensure the telemetry module on the Pixhawk is configured to transmit the data to your ground station, and make any necessary adjustments based on your specific hardware setup and requirements.

The provided code is specifically designed to transmit the live video feed captured by a camera connected to a Jetson Nano over a serial connection. If you want to integrate telemetry data from a Pixhawk (communicating via a radio telemetry module) alongside the video transmission, you'll need to modify the code to accommodate both types of data.

Here's a conceptual overview of how you might modify the code to include telemetry data transmission:

    Retrieve Telemetry Data: Use a library such as DroneKit or MAVLink to retrieve telemetry data from the Pixhawk connected to the Jetson Nano.

    Combine Telemetry Data with Video Feed: Combine the telemetry data with the video frame before encoding and transmission. You might encode the telemetry data in a structured format (e.g., JSON) and prepend it to the encoded video frame.

    Send Combined Data over Serial: Serialize the combined data (telemetry + video) into a byte array and send it over the serial connection.

    Receive and Parse Data on Ground Station: On the ground station side, receive the combined data stream, parse it to separate telemetry and video data, and process/display them accordingly.

Here's an updated version of the code with telemetry data transmission added:

python

import cv2
import json
import serial
from dronekit import connect

# Initialize serial communication with the telemetry module
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 57600)  # Adjust port and baud rate as needed

# Connect to Pixhawk for telemetry data
vehicle = connect('/dev/ttyS0', baud=57600, wait_ready=True)

# Initialize camera capture
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Assuming camera is connected to Jetson Nano

while True:
    # Capture frame-by-frame
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Encode frame to JPEG format
    _, encoded_frame = cv2.imencode('.jpg', frame)

    # Get telemetry data from Pixhawk
    telemetry_data = {
        'altitude': vehicle.location.global_relative_frame.alt,
        'pitch': vehicle.attitude.pitch,
        'roll': vehicle.attitude.roll
    }

    # Convert telemetry data to JSON format
    telemetry_json = json.dumps(telemetry_data)

    # Combine telemetry data and encoded video frame
    combined_data = telemetry_json.encode('utf-8') + b'VIDEO' + encoded_frame.tobytes()

    # Send combined data over serial
    ser.write(combined_data)

    # Break the loop if 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release resources
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

This code assumes you have the DroneKit library installed to connect to the Pixhawk and retrieve telemetry data. Adjust the telemetry data retrieval and encoding part (telemetry_data) according to your specific requirements and the data you want to transmit. Similarly, on the ground station side, you'll need to parse the combined data stream to separate telemetry and video data for processing/display.

Sure, here's an example of how you might write the code for the ground station to receive and parse the combined telemetry and video data stream:

python

import cv2
import json
import serial

# Initialize serial communication with the telemetry module on the ground station
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 57600)  # Adjust port and baud rate as needed

# Initialize camera display window
cv2.namedWindow('Live Video Feed', cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)

while True:
    # Read data from serial port
    data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8')

    # Split combined data into telemetry and video parts
    telemetry_data, _, video_data = data.partition('VIDEO')
    
    # Decode JSON telemetry data
    telemetry_dict = json.loads(telemetry_data)

    # Decode video frame
    nparr = np.frombuffer(video_data, np.uint8)
    frame = cv2.imdecode(nparr, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)

    # Display video frame
    cv2.imshow('Live Video Feed', frame)

    # Break the loop if 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release resources
ser.close()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

This code assumes that the telemetry and video data are transmitted together as a single stream over the serial connection, with the telemetry data encoded in JSON format and separated from the video data by the string "VIDEO". Adjust the parsing logic (partition() function) according to the actual format of the combined data stream.

On the ground station side, the code reads the combined data stream from the serial port, separates the telemetry and video parts, decodes the telemetry data from JSON format, and decodes the video frame using OpenCV's imdecode() function. Finally, it displays the live video feed in a window named "Live Video Feed".
final question the radio telemetry module here is connected with the pixhwak right on the drone ?
ChatGPT

Yes, that's correct. In the scenario described, the radio telemetry module is connected directly to the Pixhawk flight controller on the drone. The Pixhawk acts as the central control unit for the drone, managing flight operations and communicating with external devices, such as the radio telemetry module.

The radio telemetry module serves as the communication link between the drone (Pixhawk) and the ground station. It allows for bidirectional communication, enabling the ground station to send commands to the drone and receive telemetry data (such as GPS position, altitude, battery status, etc.) from the drone in real-time.

The telemetry module typically communicates with the ground station using radio frequencies, allowing for wireless communication over an extended range. This setup enables operators to monitor and control the drone remotely, making it suitable for various applications, including autonomous flight, aerial photography, mapping, and more.
